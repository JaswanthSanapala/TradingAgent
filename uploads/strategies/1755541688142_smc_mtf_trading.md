Key Concepts

Supply/Demand Zones: Rally-base-rally (demand) or drop-base-drop (supply), 2–5 candle base, range < 0.5x ATR(14), fresh within 20 candles.
SMC Signals:
BoS: Break above/below swing high/low (trend continuation).
CHoCH: Break with CCI(14) > +100 or < -100 (reversal).
OB: Last bearish/bullish candle before strong move, within 5 candles.
FVG: Gap where low(t) > high(t-2) or high(t) < low(t-2), within 10 pips of zone.
Liquidity: Equal highs and lows, turning points, volume clusters within 15 candles.

Price Action: Bullish/bearish engulfing or higher low/lower high on 15m.


Trading Process

4H Analysis:
Price above/below 50 SMA for bullish/bearish direction; skip if within 1% of SMA.

Confirm trend with 20 SMA and CCI(14).
Detect BoS (trend), CHoCH (reversal), OB, FVG.
Liquidity confirmation.

15m Analysis:
Enter at proximal line after engulfing or higher low/lower high.
Stop-loss: 1.5x ATR(14) beyond distal line.
